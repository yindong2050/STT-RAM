# Rule-Based Judgment Method

## Background

Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM ) is a non-volatile memory with advantages such as high density and lower power leakage, but it also has the issue of two-step state transitions（TTs）, which has a great impact on performance. The rule-based judgment method is a simple method. We use this method to obtain the minimum TTs in MLC STT-RAM. The method can reduce or even eliminate the problem of TTs.


## Software Dependencies

All versions from Java 8 and above, Eclipse, IDEA etc...

## Java Compiling

```
Eclipse, IDEA etc ...
Create a new Java project and copy all files into the project for compilation.
```

## Java Running

```
Eclipse, IDEA etc ...
Directly call the method of AdvancedCombinationMethod in the STTRAMTest.java to test.
```

## Result

When finishing executing, you can find the result in the console.&#x20;
