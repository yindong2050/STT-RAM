<h1>STT-RAM</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM ), as a form of non-volatile memory that leverages electron spin to store and retrieve data, has the potential to replace SRAM in various applications due to its advantages of
high density and lower power leakage.
