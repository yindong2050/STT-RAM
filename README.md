<h1>STT-RAM</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) is a non-volatile memory with advantages such as high density and lower power leakage. However, it has the issue of two-step state transitions（TTs）, which greatly impact performance. We use some methods to avoid TTs.
