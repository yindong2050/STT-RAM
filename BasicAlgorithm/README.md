# Basic Algorithm

## Background

Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM ) is a non-volatile memory with advantages such as high density and lower power leakage, but it also has the issue of two-step state transitions（TTs）, which has a great impact on performance. The GA algorithm is a greedy algorithm. We use this algorithm to obtain the optimal mapping method in SST-RAM. The algorithm can reduce or even eliminate the problem of TTs.

## Software dependences

All versions from Java 8 and above, Eclipse, IDEA etc...

## Java Compiling

```Eclipse, IDEA etc ...
Create a new Java project and copy all files into the project for compilation.
```

## Java Running

```Eclipse, IDEA etc ...
Directly call the method of PermunateFindMapping in the STTRAMTest.java to test.
```

## Result

When finishing executing, you can find the result in the console.&#x20;
